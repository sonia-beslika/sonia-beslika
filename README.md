:wave: Hi, I'm Sonia, a maths undergraduate at The Open University, with an interest in meteorology and oceanography.

I'm about halfway through my degree, this year I'm taking
- MS327: *Deterministic and Stochastic Dynamics*
- M248: *Analysing Data*

I'm the Chair of the [OU Weather & Climate Club](https://www.oustudents.com/organisation/6545/) <br/>
We are a really friendly group for all interests in weather and climate - here are our links: <br/>
